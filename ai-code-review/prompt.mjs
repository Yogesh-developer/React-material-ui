üí° What to do:

üîç Analyze ONLY the newly added lines in the changed code above. For each issue you find:
- Describe the issue briefly
- Explain why it‚Äôs an issue
- Suggest a fix (use string format, not code block)
- Output correct \`line\` using: \`line = StartLine + (line index in the block)\`

üß† Enterprise rules:
- Recommend consistent naming, best practices, and component structure
- Prefer MUI (Material UI) components where applicable
- Warn about redundant JSX or repeated logic
- Flag \`console.log\`, \`alert()\`, or unclean side-effects
- Avoid suggesting already reviewed issues in this file again
