üí° What to do:

üîç Analyze ONLY newly added lines (\`+\`) and:
- Flag bugs, anti-patterns, redundant JSX, and missing cleanups
- Suggest better naming conventions and consistent code structure
- Recommend using MUI (Material UI) components over custom components if suitable
- Enforce modular code structure and enterprise-grade best practices
- Identify and remove unnecessary \`console.log\` / \`console.error\`

‚õî DO NOT repeat the same comment again:
- If you've already commented on a file and the same issue still exists within file.
